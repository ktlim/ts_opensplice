    OpenSplice V6.x series of releases<br>

    <h2><a name="highlights">Release Highlights</a></h2>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.4.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ISO C++ API has been taken out of beta status and is now the 
      primary C++ API for OpenSplice DDS. Additionally, the new DDS-PSM-CXX 
      specification IDL type mapping is now implemented.
      This allows simplified usage of IDL generated types through full compatibility with the STL.
      The older CORBA compatible types are also supported.
      Please see the 
      <a href="../isocpp/html/index.html">ISO C++ Release Notes</a> for further details</li>
      </li>
      <li>A performance boost has been made to OpenSplice. The libraries are now 
      consolidated to a single dcps library ddskernel, but the other libraries are still
      available as stubs to avoid user build system changes. Additionally, other 
      optimisations have been introduced to increase performance and reduce CPU.
      <br><i>Note: If you are using a static library OpenSplice build and 'ddskernel'
      is before any of the other dds libraries e.g. -lddskernel -lddsrrstorage -lddsos then
      you may get unresolved symbols that were previously satisfied by the 'ddsos'
      at the end of the link line. To resolve this move 'ddskernel' to the end of the link line.
      </i>
      </li>
      <li>TCP support for DDSI has been implemented. Configuration options are available
      to run DDSI over a single connection.
      </li>
      <li>The CORBA cohabitation libraries have been upgraded to use TAO 2.1.
      Where customer demand exists for TAO 1.6 support, these have been left at TAO 1.6.
      </li>
      <li>The DCPS API's for Java, C, C++ and C# have been extended with a
      A QoS provider API that allows users to define QoS settings for DCPS
      entities in an XML file as standardized in the DDS For Lightweight CCM
      OMG (DDS4CCM) standard. Please see the Reference manuals for more information.</li> 
      <li>Support for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows
      platforms.</li>
      <li>Support for Raspberry Pi.</li>
      <li><a href="../pdf/EvaluatingOSPLEnterprise.pdf"> New evaluation and 
      benchmarking guide</a> and examples. Please see the RoundTrip
      and Throughput examples.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.3.3p2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The DCPS API's for Java, C, C++ and C# have been extended with a
        A QoS provider API that allows users to define QoS settings for DCPS
        entities in an XML file as standardized in the DDS For Lightweight CCM
        OMG (DDS4CCM) standard.</li>
        <li>Support for Visual Studio 2013 on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows
        platforms.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.3.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Durability Service now supports the REPLACE and DELETE merge policies.

      <ul>
         <li>With the REPLACE merge policy it is possible to dispose
              and delete historical data on a node, and replace it with the
              transient and persistent data from another node. Immediately after
              successful completion of the REPLACE merge action the replacement
              data will be available to late joining readers, the data in the
              reader queue of existing readers will be disposed and replaced with
              the replacement data, and the generation count of the replacement
              data is increased.</li>
          <li>With the DELETE merge policy it is possible to dispose and delete
              historical data on a node. Immediately after successful completion
              of the DELETE merge action the historical data in the reader queue
              of existing readers will be disposed and is not available any more
              to late joining readers.</li>
       </ul>
         Please see the deployment guide for more details.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.3.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Durability Service has new pluggable persistent stores. In previous
      versions, XML was allowed on all platforms and Memory Mapped File was also
      available on Linux only. From V6.3.1, Memory Mapped File is now deprecated.
      The new persistence stores are:</li>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLLite</a></li>
         <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>The ISO C++ API (beta) has had a new set of features added. See the
      <a href="../isocpp/html/index.html">ISO C++ Release Notes</a> for further details</li>
      </li>
      <li>Support for Yocto Linux on Freescale P4080ds.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.3.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Record and Replay is taken out of beta and now considered a GA service. It
      includes the following new features:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Compitability with the DDSI2/DDSI2E Services.</li>
         <li>The ability to remove record and/or replay interest without stopping a scenario.</li>
         <li>The ability to clear the contents of a storage during a scenario.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>DDSI2 and DDSI2E are now taken out of beta and considered as GA services.
          In completing the work on
          DDSI2 and DDSI2E, which includes adding support for IPV6, there has been a change
          to the configuration options. In all previous versions DDSI2 and DDSI2E
          used "Unsupported". This has now been changed to "Internal". Old configuration
          files will still be supported on V6 series, but a WARNING message
          will be raised to highlight the deprecated "Unsupported". The Internal
          configuration parameters are marked as such as they are subject to change
          in the future. </li>
      <li>A beta version of the ISO C++ PSM for DDS is now available. Documentation on
      what is supported in this beta version is available <a href="../../docs/isocpp/html/index.html">here.</a>
      <li>Performance optimisation for Java and C++ DataReaders to allow them to
      specify the number of threads to use when demarshalling data. Demarshalling
      data to a language-binding specific format can take considerable processing
      depending on the type of the data. Before this change this process was single-threaded
      and would therefore limit throughput, especially on multi-core platforms.
      See OSPL-1078 in the API changes section.</li>
      <li>The ospl tool is enhanced (see ospl -help for detailed info). It no
      longer returns negative error numbers. Its default is no longer stop, but -help.</li>
      <li>Support for kernel mode is added to the RTP support for VxWorks V6 series.</li>
      <li>Support for SMP (Symmetric MultiProcessing) on VxWorks V6 series.</li>
      <li>DLRL is deprecated. It will be removed from the product at V6.4.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.2.3 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for PikeOS 3.1.7 on PowerPC for Windows hosts.</a>.
      <li>Support for VxWorks 6.9 on Pentium for Windows hosts.</li>
      <li>Support for VxWorks 6.9 on Pentium3 for Windows hosts.</li>
      <li>Support for VxWorks 6.9 on PowerPC P1010/P1013 for Windows hosts.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.2.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for PikeOS 3.3. As part of this, the PikeOS port builds against
      the BSD Posix library rather than the NewLib implementation which is removed
      in 3.3.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes to the way read- and take-operations access data. The read- and
      take-operations now provide data circularly, meaning that these operations
      will &apos;resume&apos; a previous read just as if read_next_instance was
      successively called. This way all instances can be read even when for
      example lower key-values get updated between two read-operations with a
      max_samples limit.</li>
      <li>Support has been added for kernel mode for VxWorks 6.8 PENTIUM4 target.</li>
      <li>Support has been added for SMP kernels for the VxWorks 6.8 PENTIUM4 kernel
      mode build.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Adds configurability for data compression in the networking service.
     This allows tuning of the existing (zlib) method, adds two alternative
     fast compressors (lzf and snappy) and provides a plugin api for using
     other mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recording and Replay Service (beta version)<br><br>
      A second beta version of PrismTech's new recording and replay service. This version
      supports:
      <ul>
         <li>Replay the recorded data with different speeds</li>
         <li>The ability to add time conditions to a command that can delay its processing</li>
         <li>Statistics on the record and replay of data</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.2.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <h4>New product add-ons:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>DDSI-Extended (ddsi2e):
      DDSI2E is a new beta version of the extended version of PrismTech's DDSI2
      networking service, giving extra features for:
      <ul>
      <li>Network partitions : Network partitions provide the ability to use
      alternative multicast addresses for combinations of DCPS topics and partitions
      to separate out traffic flows, for example for routing or load reduction.</li>
      <li>Security : Encryption can be configured per network partition. This allows
      configuring encrypted transmission for subsets of the data.</li>
      <li>Bandwidth limiting and traffic scheduling : Any number of "network channels"
      can be defined, each with an associated transport priority. Application data
      is routed via the network channel with the best matching priority. For each
      network channel, outgoing bandwidth limits can be set and the IP "differentiated services"
      options can be controlled.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>OpenSplice Streams :
      OpenSplice Streams API supports a common data-distribution pattern where
      continuous flows or streams of data have to be transported with minimal overhead
      and therefore maximal achievable throughput. For more information see the
      <a href="../pdf/OpenSplice_refman_Streams.pdf">
      OpenSplice Streams Reference Manual</a>.</li><br>
      <li>Recording and Replay Service (beta version)<br><br>
      A first version of PrismTech's new recording and replay service. This version
      supports:
      <ul>
         <li>Record topics to an xml storage</li>
         <li>Manipulate the recorded data</li>
         <li>Ability to control the recording and replay service remotely</li>
         <li>A new tool (separate installer) to drive the recording and replay service and view its output.</li>
      </ul>
      </li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Other new features:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types annotations now handled in IDL :
      As a first step to the implementation of the OMG standard for
      Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types for DDS, a developer can now annotate their
      IDL as per the specification and when the implementation of the specification
      becomes available (OpenSplice DDS V7) then no further IDL changes should be
      required.
      </li><br>
      <li>OpenSplice RMI extensions:
      <ul>
         <li>Instances Management: Requests/Replies topic instances are per-client basis.
         The topic key is {client_name, client_instance}. To support multithreaded clients
         a configuration option named '--RMIClientThreadingModel' has been added to take two
         possible values 'ST' (Single Thread) or 'MT' (Multi Thread). The MT option will set
         the history qos to KEEP_ALL and allow then the client to be multithreaded.</li>
         <li>Service activation: The server activation has been changed to decouple the service
         activation from the service registration. This activation supports two modes: a blocking mode
         where the run operation blocks the calling thread, and a non blocking mode where
         the calling thread can perform other tasks after calling "run".</li>
         <li>Error handling and exceptions: Error reporting has been enhanced with the definition of two new exceptions :
         INTERNAL_ERROR to report any internal operation failure and SERVICE_NOT_FOUND
         to report the failure to find a requested service.</li>
         <li>The default Replies waiting timeout has beed increased to 10min (it was set to 1millisec).</li>
         <li>Asynchronous invocation mode has been added, which is similar to the CORBA
         Asynchronous Messaging Interface (AMI) call-back model, in addition to
         the conventional synchronous mode. The RMI documentation has been
         updated and new examples (Printer and HelloWorld) have been added to
         illustrate the usage of this invocation mode.</li>
      </ul><br>
      For more information see the <a href="../pdf/OpenSplice_RMI_GettingStarted.pdf">
      OpenSplice RMI GettingStarted Guide</a>.</li><br>
      </li><br>
      <li>Windows Services improvements and it is now able to write to the System Event Log, for more details see OSPL-593 below.
      </li><br>
      <br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Potential upgrade change:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul><li>In previous releases only a subset of the OpenSplice CORBA co-habitation DCPS Java API (dcpscj.jar) was
    generated using a CORBA ORB. Starting from this release (issue ospl-347), the entire CORBA-Java API is generated
    by the ORB IDL compiler. This enables customers to use internal types like ReturnCode_t and InstanceHandle_t in
    a CORBA environment, i.e. Helper and Holder classes are now available for those types as well. This changes the
    steps required to process your application Topic definition IDL files, to compile the generated and application
    source code, to run applications, and how Listener classes must be written. Additionally extra care must be taken
    not to mix the CORBA and Standalone DCPS APIs on the same compilation or VM classpath.
    <ul><li>IDL to Java code generation changes
    <p>Given the below IDL definition:<br><br>
    /* @file: Foo.idl */<br>
    struct Bar {/<br>
        long key;/<br>
    };/<br>
    #pragma keylist Bar key/<br>
    </p>
    <p>At OSPL 6.1 the required CORBA-Java DCPS code-generation steps were:
    <br><br>
    1 / $JACORB_HOME/bin/idl Foo.idl/<br><br>
    This produced files:/<br>
    BarHelper.java/<br>
    BarHolder.java/<br>
    Bar.java/<br><br>
    2/ $OSPL_HOME/bin/idlpp -C -l java Foo.idl/<br><br>
    This produced files:/<br>
    BarDataReaderHelper.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderHolder.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderImpl.java/<br>
    BarDataReader.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderOperations.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHelper.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHolder.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewImpl.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderView.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewOperations.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterHelper.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterHolder.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterImpl.java/<br>
    BarDataWriter.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterOperations.java/<br>
    BarMetaHolder.java/<br>
    BarSeqHolder.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupportHelper.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupportHolder.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupport.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupportOperations.java/<br><br>

    Now at OSPL 6.2 the required steps are:<br><br>
    1/ $JACORB_HOME/bin/idl Foo.idl<br><br>

    This step is the same as 6.1 and produces the same files.<br><br>
    2/ $OSPL_HOME/bin/idlpp -C -l java Foo.idl<br><br>
    This step is the same command as 6.1 however the files produced are now:
    BarDataReaderImpl.java<br>
    BarDataReaderViewImpl.java<br>
    BarDataWriterImpl.java<br>
    BarMetaHolder.java<br>
    BarTypeSupport.java<br>
    FooDcps.idl<br><br>
    3/ $JACORB_HOME/bin/idl -I$OSPL_HOME/etc/idl FooDcps.idl<br><br>
    This step is new at 6.2 and processes the *Dcps.idl file now produced by step 2 with the ORB IDL compiler. This produces the below files, per the IDL to Java mapping:
    BarDataReaderHelper.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderHolder.java *<br>
    BarDataReader.java *<br>
    _BarDataReaderLocalBase.java<br>
    BarDataReaderLocalTie.java<br>
    BarDataReaderOperations.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHelper.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHolder.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderView.java *<br>
    _BarDataReaderViewLocalBase.java<br>
    BarDataReaderViewLocalTie.java<br>
    BarDataReaderViewOperations.java *<br>
    BarDataWriterHelper.java *<br>
    BarDataWriterHolder.java *<br>
    BarDataWriter.java *<br>
    _BarDataWriterLocalBase.java<br>
    BarDataWriterLocalTie.java<br>
    BarDataWriterOperations.java *<br>
    BarSeqHelper.java<br>
    BarSeqHolder.java *<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceHelper.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceHolder.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterface.java<br>
    _BarTypeSupportInterfaceLocalBase.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceLocalTie.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceOperations.java<br><br>

    Files marked with an * were previously produced by step 2 (i.e. idlpp); note the file BarTypeSupportOperations.java is no longer produced by any step.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>CORBA co-habitation Java DCPS compilation<br><br>
    At 6.1 it was sometimes possible to compile code generated as above and / or applications like:<br><br>
    javac -classpath javac -cp .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar BarDataReader.java<br><br>
    For compilation errors to be avoided this must now always be:<br><br>
    javac -endorseddirs $JACORB_HOME/lib/endorsed -cp .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar BarDataReader.java<br>
    ...or...<br>
    javac -Djava.endorsed.dirs=$JACORB_HOME/lib/endorsed -cp .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar BarDataReader.java<br><br>
    See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/</a>
    </li>
    <li>Running CORBA co-habitation Java DCPS applications<br><br>
    At 6.1 it was possible to sometimes run applications like:<br><br>
    java -classpath .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar FooApp<br><br>
    At 6.2 this form must be used instead:<br><br>
    java -classpath .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar -Djava.endorsed.dirs=$JACORB_HOME/lib/endorsed FooApp<br><br>
    See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/</a>
    </li>
    <liListener classes</li>
    Because all classes are now properly implementing CORBA interfaces and inheriting from CORBA base classes,
    derived classes will be required to provide an implementation for all abstract operations mentioned
    in the generated interface from the LocalObject base.<br><br>
    One option is to add no-op implementations of the abstract Object base methods e.g.:<br><br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _set_policy_override(org.omg.CORBA.Policy[] policies, org.omg.CORBA.SetOverrideType set_add) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.DomainManager[] _get_domain_managers() { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Policy _get_policy(int policy_type) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Request _create_request(org.omg.CORBA.Context ctx, java.lang.String operation, org.omg.CORBA.NVList arg_list, org.omg.CORBA.NamedValue result, org.omg.CORBA.ExceptionList exclist, org.omg.CORBA.ContextList ctxlist) { return null; <br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Request _create_request(org.omg.CORBA.Context ctx, java.lang.String operation, org.omg.CORBA.NVList arg_list, org.omg.CORBA.NamedValue result) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Request _request(java.lang.String operation) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _get_interface_def() { return null; }<br>
    public void _release() {}<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _duplicate() { return null; }<br>
    public int _hash(int maximum) { return 0; }<br>
    public boolean _non_existent() { return false; }<br>
    public boolean _is_equivalent(org.omg.CORBA.Object other) { return false; }<br>
    public boolean _is_a(java.lang.String repositoryIdentifier) { return false; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _get_component() { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.InterfaceDef _get_interface ( ) { return null;<br><br>

    Alternately, for the case of Listeners, OpenSplice supplies the ListenerBase class as a convenience.
    When Listeners extend from this base class they are no longer required to implement these operations themselves.
    So a Listener defined like:<br><br>
    public class MyReaderListener implements DataReaderListener {<br>
    ... <br><br>
    could instead be defined:<br><br>
    public class MyReaderListener extends org.opensplice.dds.dcps.ListenerBase implements DataReaderListener {<br>
    ... <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>CORBA & Standalone Java DCPS API jar incompatibility<br><br>
    Previously the dcpscj.jar & dcpssaj.jar were largely identical and could often reside safely on the same CLASSPATH.
    In fact, the release.com/.bat script provided with OpenSplice placed both jars on the exported/set CLASSPATH environment
    variable. This is no longer the case - users must take care to specify the correct jar on their CLASSPATH
    when building and running applications as they are now incompatible. For this reason the release.com/.bat

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new OpenSplice DDS deployment architecture which offers daemon-less deployment
      to go alongside the existing daemon (shared memory) deployment is now available.
      The new daemon-less library mode is what we call a <b>Single Process</b> deployment option
      where an application will dynamically link at runtime all OpenSplice libraries and
      services into a single operating-system process.
      For more information see Chapter 1 of the Deployment Guide. The choice of
      daemon or daemon-less architecture can be made by simply changing the ospl configuration
      file, and therefore does not require any application code changes nor re-generation of the application.
      Users on windows will find this particularly useful to avoid the need to find a free
      location in shared memory for the nodal administration database.</li><br>
      <li>OpenSplice RMI, a new set of APIs available with OpenSplice DDS that complement the
      pub/sub integration pattern of DDS with a new/client server pattern, but over 1
      middleware.
      For more information on this exciting new addition to the OpenSplice DDS product line,
      please see the OpenSplice RMI Getting Started Guide.</li><br>
      <li>OpenSplice Tester, a tool aimed at automated regression testing and debugging of OpenSplice DDS
      based systems is now available. For more information on this exciting new addition to the
      OpenSplice DDS product line, please see the OpenSplice Tester Guide and/or
      use the builtin help of the Tester itself.</li><br>
      <li>Support for data reader TIME_BASED_FILTER Qos Policy</li><br>
      <li>The OpenSplice configurator is context sensitive to the enabled features and will
      only allow access to attributes of relevance (for either the community or commercial edition used).
      </li><br>
      <li>DDSI2 now allows setting the multicast time-to-live for outgoing packets using the
      General/MulticastTimeToLive element. Setting the time-to-live differently for
      each multicast address is not yet possible.</li><br>
      <li>Code for a plugin for <A HREF=http://www.wireshark.org>Wireshark</A>, which
      will allow decoding of Real Time networking packets is provided. For more

            <i>
               When an idl-union contained a case called 'discriminator', the
               generated java-code would contain two conflicting definitions for
               the 'discriminator' method. This method is always included in a
               class generated from a union to obtain the value of the
               union-discriminator. With a discriminator case an additional
               discriminator method is added with the same signature that returns
               the value of the discriminator field. 
              </br>
              </br>
              <b>Solution:  The solution is according to the IDL to Java

            <i>
                If multiple string keys exist for a Topic that is being persisted
                by the durability service, samples for different instances may be
                interpreted as samples for the same instance causing potentially
                samples to be overwritten while they both are supposed to be
                maintained. Secondly, if one or more key-values contained new-lines,
                storage in XML was also done in a way that prevented the data from
                being republished correctly after system restart. Finally, if the
                string key was matching the "</TOPIC>" closing tag in the XML
                implementation, samples matching this key would not be persisted in all cases.

              <b>Solution: Key-values are now escaped when storing them in XML.

               On Windows, when a message is truncated because there is insufficient
               receive buffer space available, the error message produced by DDSI2
               would be somewhat confusing, because Windows reports this as an
               error whereas DDSI2 assumed POSIX behaviour of treating this as
               an unusual situation rather than an actual error. The behaviour
               of DDSI2 was ok, in that it discarded the message regardless of
               the platform.

            <i>
               When using DDSI2 it was possible that during durability alignment
               a duplicate message was received which could not be identified as
               a duplicate because the sequencenumbers were different. DDSI2
               increments the sequencenumber for each message it sends, this
               sequencenumber is unrelated to the message sequencenumber which
               is not communicated to the receiving node when using DDSI2.

              Description: The dispose_all_data call creates specific samples that
              were not compatible with durability alignment. The durability service
              could not handle these samples, while there are possible scenario's
              where these samples get stored in a persistent store. The service
              incorrectly forwarded all initial alignment data to the networking
              service, which could result in a crash since it could also not
              handle these samples, which are meant for local delivery only. A
              crash could also occur if the dispose_all_data sample was the first
              sample to be received, which could happen because of order reversal

              Description: The sample re-ordering mechanism internal to DDSI2 could
              use freed memory under very particular circumstances, requiring the
              number of buffered samples to have reached its maximum size as well
              as a particular order of arrival of out-of-sequence samples at the
              high end of the sequence number range. This is unlikely to occur
              in normal circumstances, using networks of "normal" reliability 
              (such as Ethernet) and with receivers that generally keep up with the data flow.

            <i>
              Description: DDSI2 would completely fail to work when the WHC water
              marks were set very low. More precisely, if DDSI2 would block because
              the number of outstanding unacknowledged messages (N_UNACK) exceeded
              the high water mark, and its dynamic message packer had buffered so
              many samples that the readers would not yet be able to acknowledge
              enough samples to drop N_UNACK below the low water mark,
              communication would stop. This also affects endpoint discovery.<br> 

              One of the consequences of the inability to operate with low water
              mark settings meant that it was impossible to operate DDSI2 in the
              safest configuration, where each sample must be acknowledged before
              sending the next, thereby potentially causing many more
              retransmissions. This is especially problematic if the network is
              unreliable, or the receivers are unable to keep up with the influx of data.

            <i>
              With the delayed alignment enabled, durability accepts the
              introduction of a new persistent data-set in the system even after
              the start-up phase in case no data has been re-published from
              permanent storage by any durability service and no application has
              published any sample so far either. When a new data-set is detected
              in the operational phase and delayed alignment is required, the
              durability service marked all partition-topic combinations as
              incomplete instead of only marking the ones that match the name-space
              for which delayed alignment is required. As a result the
              partition-topic combinations that do not belong to the name-space
              will never be marked as complete again. In case another durability
              service wants to align from this durability service after that, it
              concludes that the set of data over there is incomplete, where it
              actually is complete. This leads the alignment process on the
              newly joining node to fail.
              <br><br>

            <b>Durability Service behaviour with no aligner</b><br/>
            <i>
              The current behaviour of a durability service is: when no aligner
              is available a durability service that cannot act as aligner itself
              will wait until an aligner becomes available. This is not desirable
              in all cases.

              When no aligner is available a durability service that cannot act
              as aligner itself will wait until an aligner becomes available. If
              no aligner becomes available, the durability service will wait forever.
              In some situations it may be desirable to exit instead. This behaviour
              has been made configurable using the TimeToWaitForAligner-option.
              Currently two values are supported, 0.0 (exit if no aligner is available)
              and 1.0 (wait until an aligner becomes available). The default is
              1.0 which matches the original behaviour.
              When the durability service exits error code 1 (recoverable error) is returned.

              When the durability configuration file does not configure a

              included in the namespace. Also, a policy for the namespace was
              not provided. As a consequence the nodes initially would try to
              align their namespaces, but would never reach a 'complete' state
              because the CMParticipantInfo topic could never be aligned. This
              causes the system to indefinitely try to align the namespace for

              ('any'), or to the NetworkInterfaceAddress ('strict'). The boolean
              'allowReuse' attribute specifies whether the SO_REUSEADDR option

             <i>
               In the case where a reader and a writer are running on different
               nodes and the nodes are disconnected, then samples at the reader
               are marked as NOT_ALIVE. When the connection is re-established and
               durability is configured to re-align the lost samples, the reader
               is expected to show the samples again. Because the unregistration
               of a sample is treated as a new sample and this sample has the
               policy BY_RECEPTION_TIME, the unregistration is treated as a
               new sample that needs to be aligned by the durability. Consequently,
               the unregistration incorrectly reverts the aliveness of the sample.<br/><br/>
               Additionally, the process to determine a new master durability service
               is not taking into account the proper time-outs causing temporary
               conflicting masters and that results in superfluous alignment of
               data to take place.<br/><br/>
               <b>Solution:  The durability service is changed. It now prevents
               to process updates of samples from writers with your own ID. This
               means that you do not process data from anybody that tells
               something about your data.<br/><br/>
               The durability service now also takes into account the proper
               heartbeat expiry-time when determining a new master to prevent
               superfluous alignment of data. As a consequence the default
               heartbeat time-out has changed to prevent alignment in default
               configurations to take longer. The default expiry-time is now
               4 seconds instead of 10. The deployment guide has not been
               updated yet to reflect this change.</b>

               Socket blocking and waiting behaviour on Windows does not really
               support waiting for packets to arrive on a number of sockets in

               another thread, as the socket is either blocking or non-blocking.
               The auxiliary data transmission used a socket that was also in use
               for receiving data. Consequently, once the socket send buffer
               filled up, the Windows kernel could return error 10035, EWOULDBLOCK.
               In such a case the packet would be dropped. The protocol is such
               that these lost packets would not affect correctness, but it does

            <i>
               If a service dies it may not have performed a detach from the
               OpenSplice kernel/database and so the attached services count may
                be incorrect. That could lead to a crash of a database thread
                because the spliced may get detached too early.

              <b>Solution: When spliced detects that a service has died, it
              ensures that attached services count is correctly maintained,

               When the durability service on start-up detects that the current

               of the set of persistent data during the previous run, it will
               check if there is an older but complete set still available on disk.
               If so it will replace the newer but incomplete set with the older
               but complete set after which durability services in the domain will
               determine who has the latest complete set and use that one everywhere.

          number of messages from a single writer, one for each partition.
          All these message were forwarded by DDSI2 and filtered out by the
          subscribers running OpenSplice. However, this required extra bandwidth
          and besides caused other vendors' implementations of the DDSI protocol
          to report them as independent updates.
          <br><br>
          <b>Solution: This behaviour has now been changed, so that DDSI2 filters
          out such duplicates in the vast majority of cases. In particular, as long
          as the writer, its local subscribers and the networking services do not
          run into resource limits, it is guaranteed to filter out all duplicates.
          The filter can, under very unlikely circumstances, conclude a message
          is a duplicate when in reality it is not. This requires publishing more
          than 4 billion samples with a single writer while carefully controlling
          the behaviour of the writer history cache using resource limits on local
          readers; a situation no real system is likely to ever encounter.

         The dispose_all_data operation on the topic was not treated identically
         to sending a separate dispose message for every entity. This manifested
         itself especially in the way the disposed data was delivered to late
         joiners (which sometimes couldn't see that the data was actually disposed)
         and in the way disposed data ignored the cleanup delay specified on the
         durability service.
         <br><br>
         <b>Solution: The new implementation of dispose_all_data is much
         more inline with sending separate dispose messages for every instance,
         and thus late joiners will always see the correct instance state.
         Furthermore the dispose messages obey the same cleanup delays as normal
         dispose messages. However, the dispose_all_data function will still be
         me more efficient with respect to the utilization of network network
         bandwitdth, CPU cycles and memory than the manual transmission of

          In a scenario where a specific topic was created for the first time in
          the system, but for which a duplicate was created by another application
          before the original could enable its topic, a refCount to the resulting
          topic got dropped and that topic could suddenly disappear while still
          being used by the system.

            <i>
              TDDSI2 defragmentation buffers have limited capacity and when full
              decide what to accept and what to drop on a policy that favours
              lower sequence numbers of higher ones in case of reliable communication.
              This policy causes the buffers to fill up slowly when every now and then
              a subset of the fragments of a sample arrive, but not all of them.
              This can only happen for "old" samples, as they have will been delivered
              to the data readers and no retransmits will be requested. Under normal
              circumstances it is very rare to receive some retransmitted fragments
              after receiving the full sample, but on networks with long delays,
              reordering and packet loss, such as a WAN, this problem is quite likely
              to surface.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The current solution actively drops already accepted data
              from the defragmentation buffers, preventing uncontrolled build-up of

              fragments of a sample while simultaneously requesting a retransmit of the
              full sample.

              DDSI2 always generates the keyhashes included in the DDSI standard
              (they are spec'd as optional). For topics of which the (big-endian) CDR
              representation of the key is or may be longer than 16 bytes the keyhash
              is computed as the MD5 hash of the serialized key.DDSI2 produces an incorrect
              hash on little-endian platforms for keys containing bounded strings where
              the total serialized length of the key is &gt= 17 and &lt=32 bytes. In

              a single global log directory that would hold all OpenSplice service
              and application process logs. When selecting to install the domain as
              a Windows service an incompatible 'single process mode' OpenSplice XML
              configuration file was installed by default.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: Installing and running OpenSplice services as a Windows

              entry to direct the log output from service processes to the Windows
              Event Log,for instance:

          &lt;Finalize symbol_name="service_logger_shutdown" /&gt;
          &lt;SuppressDefaultLogs&gt;True&lt;/SuppressDefaultLogs&gt;
          &lt;!-- Change below to 'False' if you wish to log OpenSplice system log events from application proceses

             </pre>
             See the Deployment Guide for more information regarding log plug-in configuration.
             Note that by default OpenSplice log events from application processes
             will still now be written to ospl-error/info.log files in the local
             directory, just as when not running OpenSplice as a Windows Service,
             but that this can be changed as per the comment in the snippet above.
             Note also that this entry can still be added to your OpenSplice domain
             configuration when OpenSplice is not installed as a Windows Service to
             direct service (or service and application) log output to the Event Log.

            <i>
               In multi-homed systems it is often necessary to instruct DDSI2 which
               network interface to use using the General/NetworkInterfaceAddress
               setting. Until now, this required specifying the exact IP address
               of the host for that network interface, in essence requiring each
               host to have its own configuration file.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: New options for specifying the network interface have been added:
              <ul>
              <li>The name of an interface (e.g., eth1) is now acceptable</li>
              <li>For IPv4 networks, if there is no exact match on the full IPv4 address,
              DDSI2 will attempt to match on the network portion only as determined by
              the network masks of the interfaces. It requires that the host portion
              of the specified address is all-zero for such a match.</li>
              </ul>
              With these changes, in the vast majority of cases, there is no longer a
              need for a configuration file per host. Furthermore, a warning is appended
              to the info log whenever DDSI2 automatically selects an interface out
              of several available that have equal ranking. The ranking itself is unchanged,
              with multicast-capable networks preferred over others, then anything
              non-point-to-point, point-to-point and loopback interfaces.</b>

              "In deployment scenarios, use Windows Installer 2.0 to install
              assemblies into the global assembly cache. Use the Global Assembly
              Cache tool only in development scenarios, because it does not provide

              To make sure that instances are not registered by DataWriters that no longer exist

              inject a self created unregister message for each unique DataWriter for an instance
              and that is proper behavior. However, the unregister message needs to be freed after
              it has been injected and that part is missing. This causes every unregister message

            <i>
               Demarshalling data to a language-binding specific format may take considerable
               processing depending on the type of the data. Since demarshalling is done by the
               application thread performing the read/take, demarshalling occurs single-threadedly,
               limiting the throughput that can be achieved.<br>
               <b>Solution:</b> The C++ and Java datareaders have been extended with support for
               demarshalling with multiple threads. The number of threads used can be controlled
               by using the new set_property(DDS::Property) operation on C++ and Java datareaders.
               The property "parallelReadThreadCount" accepts a string representing a positive integer
               (e.g., "4") as value. If the call was successful, successive read/take operations on
               that datareader will use the provided number of threads for the demarshalling step of
               the respective operations.

            <b>Solution: The default behaviour is now to always append to a storage,
            when its resources (i.e. XML files) exist. If the resources do not exist
            they will be silently created, if possible. The overwrite-behaviour
            that was achieved by setting the mode to 'w', has been replaced by
            a separate TRUNCATE command. This command will remove all data from

            of individual record/replay interest instead of forcibly removing all

            contains separate commands to either add or remove interest to record
            or replay data belonging to a specific partition/topic. For example,
            to stop recording data, a REMOVE_RECORD command must be issued,
            containing interest expressions that match exactly the expressions
            of the ADD_RECORD command that initiated the recording. Currently

              is generated by the IDL compiler that comes with the ORB. This enables

              in a Corba environment, i.e. Helper and Holder classes are now available
              for those types as well.

              Because all classes are now properly implementing Corba interfaces and
              inheriting from Corba base classes, derived classes are required to
              provide an implementation for all abstract operations mentioned in the

              class as a convenience. When Listeners extend from this base class

            <b>DDSI2 used incorrect encoding for fragment data message headers</b><br/>
            <i>
             DDSI2 incorrectly used to generate and interpret fragmented data message headers
             as if they were slightly extended versions of the non-fragmented data message headers.
             This caused DDSI2 to be non-compliant with respect to the standard and to fail to
             interoperate with other vendors' implementations for large samples.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The setting and interpretation has been corrected. This breaks backwards
              compatibility. For those exceptional cases where backwards compatibility is currently
              an issue, a setting Unsupported/LegacyFragmentation has been introduced,
              which may be set to true to continue using and interpreting the old message format.</b>

            <b>Change in ReaderLifecycle QoS (invalid sample setting)</b><br/>
            <i>
               The QoS setting that determines if OpenSplice creates invalid samples
               to communicate state changes, called 'enable_invalid_samples', is now deprecated.
               Invalid samples, in the past, could either be enabled or disabled.
               There is a replacement QoS setting, called 'invalid_sample_visibility',
               which accepts three values:<br>
               - MINIMUM_INVALID_SAMPLES: Acts like the old enable_invalid_samples = true, an invalid sample will be created if there's no regular sample on which the state change can be piggy-backed (this is the default behavior).<br>
               - NO_INVALID_SAMPLES: Acts like the old enable_invalid_samples = false, no invalid samples are created.<br>
               - ALL_INVALID_SAMPLES: Currently not implemented, but in the future will create an invalid samples for all state changes even if a regular sample is available.<br>
               Using the QoS deprecated setting will cause a message to be logged to the info log. This QoS will be removed from the product in the future. If applicable it is recommended to switch application code
               to the new invalid_sample_visibility setting instead.

               OpenSplice default DataWriter reliability QoS was set to BEST_EFFORT.
               This was conflicting with the spec which states that default DataWriter
               reliability QoS should be RELIABLE.

            <b>Domain ID change from string to integer</b><br/>
            <i>
               The DDS API prescribes a create_participant() method to create a DomainParticipant.
               A DomainParticipant is the entry-point for an application to a specific Domain. To
               be able to create a DomainParticipant for a specific Domain, the create_participant()
               call requires a DomainId_t as parameter. In the specification the type of this DomainId_t
               is 'native' meaning that every vendor is free to choose its own type. In OpenSpliceDDS
               the type of a DomainId_t was a string and represented either the name of the Domain or a
               URI that points to the location of the configuration for the Domain to connect too.
               This has now become an integer domain ID. With this change OpenSpliceDDS now complies with
               other vendors on the DomainId_t type and the DDS interoperability specification (DDS-I)
               can use it now to select the port-number for discovery for a specific Domain.
