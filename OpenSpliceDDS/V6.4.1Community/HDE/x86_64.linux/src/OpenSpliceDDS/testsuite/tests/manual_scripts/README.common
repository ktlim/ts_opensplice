Several assumptions are made in the scripts in this directory and its
subdirectories.

* Each executable script (ending with .sh extension) can be run with -h
(or --help) option which will print all possible configuration options for
a given script. After help is printed the script will exit. It's advised to
run -h option before doing any real things.

* Work on Windows must start with a launch of Cygwin.bat which is located
in this directory. This script will setup OSPL and VS correctly.

* Work on Linux should be done in a clean environment. I.e. no OSPL related
environment variables should be set. Everything required is done by scripts.

* OSPL is installed using the installOSPL.sh script. This script cleans and
prepares config files for later use by other scripts. It also makes sure that
license file is copied to the OSPL installation.

* All configuration variables are stored in a single file (namely,
osplsettings.shsrc_$USER) and those variables are exported into running script.
So, when extending the scripts special attention is required to avoid name
clashes.

* All variable values in osplsettings.shsrc_$USER if not stated otherwise are
case sensitive.

* All paths in osplsettings.shsrc_$USER on Windows must use slashes '/' instead
of backslashes '\'. I.e. a path 'C:\some\path' must be 'C:/some/path'.

* In order to run any tests they first has to be built. This process is partly
automated (with these scripts) but each build script has to be run manually on
each host that participates in testing. So, in other words the build process is
always local.

* Each testing host runs instance of STAF specific to a user.
