* First read ../README.common.


* In order to build Examples run build_C.sh and build_java.sh.
A good way for doing this is the following command:
./build_C.sh && ./build_java.sh

The build scripts require the following tools:
  make    - must be on the path (On Linux)
  devenv  - must be on the path (On Windows)
  javac   - must be on the path (On both Linux and Windows)

Details about building Examples can be found here:
https://scarab.prismtech.com/twiki/bin/view/DDS/PingPongExample
https://scarab.prismtech.com/twiki/bin/view/DDS/TutorialExample


* To run examples start sequentially run_PingPong.sh and run_Tutorial.sh. The
output to the console is also saved in screen.log. A short way to run the
examples is the following (note using --clean-logs only for the first script;
using it for the second script as well will clean the logs for the first script
since examples use the same directory for the logging):
./run_PingPong.sh --clean-logs && ./run_Tutorial.sh


* After the scripts are done run savelogs.sh which will tar logs and OSPL
xml configs used for the testing in a file examplesYYYY-MM-DD_SSSSSSSSSS.tgz
in a current directory.
