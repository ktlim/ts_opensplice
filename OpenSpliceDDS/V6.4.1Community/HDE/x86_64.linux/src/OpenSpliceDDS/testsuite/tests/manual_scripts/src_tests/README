These scripts can run on its own. I.e. they don't depend on other routines in
scripts for manual testing.

The script run_tests.sh is organized so that it steps from one test to another
allowing to run things required for each test manually. Since this script
doesn't run anything but just prepares everything required for a test then
naturally it must be launched on each host that we are testing.
