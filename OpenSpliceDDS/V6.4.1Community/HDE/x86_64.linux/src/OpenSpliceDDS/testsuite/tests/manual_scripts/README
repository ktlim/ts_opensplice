* First read README.common.


* installOSPL.sh is used in installing OSPL. OSPL can be either installed from
OSPL distribution or by moving a directory with previously installed OSPL
distribution. The later is useful when there is a need for temporarily
installing other OSPL distribution without removing the current one. In this
case the current installation is renamed by installOSPL.sh and a new one is
installed.


* ospldevenv.sh script can be used to setup environment for building OSPL
from sources. Note: when building OSPL from source Cygwin.bat has to be setup
differently.


* restartSTAF.sh restarts STAF for the current user if STAF was running and
start a new instance of STAF if it was not. If STAX script was interrupted
with Ctrl+C on Linux then most likely STAF needs to be restarted.


* .cp_chmod is an internal file and is not intended for direct use.


* watchlogs.sh helps to watch test logs as a single stream on the console or
redirected to a file. In this case there is no need to traverse all log
directories and their subdirectories which can be rather cumbersome.
