* First read ../README.common.


* In order to build TouchStones run getNpatchNbuild.sh. It requires the
following tools:
  patch   - must be on the path
  svn     - must be on the path
  make    - must be on the path (On Linux)
  cl      - must be on the path (On Windows)
  link    - must be on the path (On Windows. Note: this has to be a VS
            linker not a GNU tool with the same name located at /bin/link.
            The easiest way to achieve the later is to copy link executable
            from VS installation to $HOME/bin and uncomment lines that add
            this path to PATH env variable in .bash_profile.)

* Run run_TouchstonesMN.sh for MultiNode test and run_TouchstonesSN.sh for
SingleNode test. This will take quite some time. The script's log is redirected
to screen.log. A short way to run the touchstones is the following:
./run_TouchstonesSN.sh --clean-logs && ./savelogsSN.sh && ./run_TouchstonesMN.sh --clean-logs && ./savelogsMN.sh


* After the tests are done run savelogsSN.sh and savelogMN.sh. They will save
all logs in a file touchstones_results(S|M)N_YYYY-MM-DD_SSSSSSSSSS.tgz in the
current directory.
